A Network Tour of Data Science: A Cooking Approach

In order to run the project, you need to register http://im2recipe.csail.mit.edu/dataset/download/ and download the layers archive.
Afterwards, you just need to open clean_dataset.ipynb and pass the path of the downloaded and uncomprossed json file.
You can select the amount of samples to clean. Once the dataset is cleaned you can run the project.
